#I downloaded multiple tables from the chinook database and queried the data using the following requests/questions. 

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT firstname, lastname, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA'; 

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, i.invoiceid, i.billingcountry, i.invoicedate
FROM chinook.invoices i 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE i.billingcountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Sales%Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry 
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, i.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c 
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i 
ON c.customerid = i.customerid;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, c.firstname, c.lastname, c.country, i.total
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c 
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid;


#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices 
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.name, i.invoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON i.trackid = t.trackid;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT i.invoicelineid, t.name as track, artist.name as artist
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.trackid = t.trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums albums
ON t.albumid = albums.albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists as artist
ON albums.artistid = artist.artistid;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.name as 'TrackName', a.title as 'AlbumTitle', g.name as genre, m.name as media_type
FROM chinook.albums a
JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON a.albumid = t.albumid
JOIN chinook.genres g 
ON t.genreid = g.genreid
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON m.mediatypeid = t.mediatypeid;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT ROUND(SUM(total)) as totalsales, e.firstname, e.lastname
FROM chinook.employees e
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c 
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE title LIKE '%Sales%Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname;

#.14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT SUM(total) as totalsales, e.firstname, e.lastname
FROM chinook.invoices i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'
AND title LIKE 'Sales% Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname
ORDER BY totalsales DESC
LIMIT 1;
