#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1.How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) =6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum, FebSales.orderid
FROM BIT_DB.customers Customers 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON Customers.order_id = 
FebSales.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID'
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID'
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product,
sum(quantity),  
sum(quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct Customers.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Customers 
ON FebSales.orderid = Customers.order_id
WHERE quantity >2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'ORDER ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), location 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
